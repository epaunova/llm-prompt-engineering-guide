## 📌 Overview

This guide is a **step-by-step breakdown** of how to approach **prompt engineering** and **training large language models (LLMs)**, drawing from real-world processes used in production-level systems like GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA, and enriched with techniques from [LearnPrompting.org](https://learnprompting.org/docs/introduction). Whether you're fine-tuning a foundation model or building domain-specific LLMs, this guide covers foundational theory, advanced training strategies, and alignment methodologies.

## 🧠 1. Understanding LLMs

Large Language Models are deep neural networks trained on massive text corpora to predict the next token in a sequence. They use:

- Transformer architecture (decoder-only models like GPT)
- Tokenization techniques (e.g., BPE, SentencePiece)
- Self-supervised objectives (next-token prediction)

> GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA are trained on trillions of tokens across diverse data domains.

## 💬 2. What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the science of designing inputs to steer an LLM's behavior. It helps achieve:

- Task control
- Response formatting
- Safety and bias mitigation
- Output quality tuning
